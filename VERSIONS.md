# smart-contracts-core

## Next Version
### Features

### Fixes

### Deprecations


## Version 2.11.0
### Features
- update identity contracts' purpose handling
  - to match updated purpose handling

  - only one account with purpose 3 is allowed per identity


## Version 2.10.0
### Features
- Added deactivation feature for `DidRegistry`
- Added precompiled contracts

  - in the browser you have to set window.process.env.EVAN_CHAIN to `core` or `testcore` then
  - when nothing set, `testcore` is the default

## Version 2.4.0
### Features
- add delegation support to ``KeyHolder``
  + delegated calls require a signed hash, that is built from transaction input, identity address and its transaction nonce

### Deprecations
- removed `dbcp.json` and moved it to [ui-dapps/dapps/smartcontracts](https://github.com/evannetwork/ui-dapps/tree/master/evan-libs/smartcontracts))


## Version 2.0.0
### Features
- already deployed libraries can be given as property `librariesAddresses` to constructor
- bytecodes to keep in reduced compiled file can be given as propety `allowedByteCodes` to constructor
- dependencies between libraries can be given as property `libraryDependencies` to constructor
- setting property `compileContracts` to `true` now compiles contracts, even if source files have not changed since last compile time
- update `build-contracts` to deploy missing libraries
- add `deployedAt` for libraries in compiled contracts
- add flag `disableSubVerifications` to verifications
- wallet only keeps hash of original input and deletes data after executing it

### Deprecations
- `DSRolesPerContract` uses own lib for logic
- `BaseContractZero` (temporary name) uses own lib for logic but breaks compatibility with regular `BaseContract` inheritance
- `DataContract` uses own lib for logic, inherits from `BaseContractZero` instead of regular `BaseContract`
- `EnsReader` contract `getAddr` is now public
- replace dependency of `DataContractIndex` with `DataContractIndexInterface` in `BusinessCenterInterface`
- `KeyHolder` constructor now needs an address argument for settings its owner
